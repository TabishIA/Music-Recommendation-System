# Music_Recommendation_System

This project was developed as part of a **Machine Learning Lab Assignment** at Pune Insitute of Computer Technology. It utilizes **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **Cosine Similarity** algorithms for recommending similar songs based on audio features like danceability, energy, loudness, and tempo.

## Project Overview

The system takes user input in the form of a song title and artist name, then recommends five similar songs. It uses two algorithms to compute similarity between songs:
- **KNN**: A supervised learning algorithm that finds the closest 'k' songs based on feature similarity.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the cosine of the angle between feature vectors, focusing on the similarity of direction rather than magnitude.

## Algorithms Used
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Cosine Similarity**
